# Windows Shell Keys

![my context menu](menu.png)

These are some registry tweaks that I have created to boost my own productivity as a software developer who occasionally works on a Windows 10 system. They add context menu entries to Windows Explorer for launching various types of CLI shells that I use (like WSL and Cygwin).

## Hold down shift (or not)

These registry files follow my personal preference. It is my preference to not clutter up the context menus, so all of these tweaks require holding down the shift key while right clicking. You can make one of the entries persistent (visible without holding shift) by removing the ```"Extended"=""``` line from the corresponding file.
